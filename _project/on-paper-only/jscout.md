### SYSTEM ORGANIZATION
System development consist of following module.
* A voice input output module to take user inputs and read out responses or queries. (Android APIâ€™s can be used).
* A database of individual users to store his/her preferences likes dislikes, work history etc.
* A collection of jokes, and other entertainment stuff.
* A database to store web sources to fetch online content like videos, pictures, news etc.

### DEVELOPMENT PLAN
In initial configuration user is asked to input his/her likes, dislikes, and other preferences by an interactive session. As this application gets to know you, it will ask you what would you like to do, and suggest you cool entertainment stuff as per your response, by fetching online content which is already categorized. This app keeps doing this with other users who are using this app and thus if someone with same preferences is found you are notified, and options like chat, play etc are given.
This app keep tracks of places you love to visit, and using Google maps it suggest you places when you are near one. This app will gives you on the go work facility by interacting with apps like MS office etc and maintains a cloud storage to sync your work.

Firstly we will integrate voice input and output module to take user inputs and store them in database with user account, and respond in voice to ask questions or to give suggestions. After getting user input we will match them with the categorized data which is created by this application. we will keep updating this data, and online resources, for better results. we will show the content with matching category. After achieving this we will start showing people with similar interests with options of chat and play, after this we will make this app capable of interacting with other apps such as Ms Office, chat clients etc.

### Equipment Required
* Cloud Server
