# Sketcher

<hr>
### INTRODUCTION

Sketcher aims at providing an easy medium for people(especially kids and artists) to just draw their imagination on air. The motion detection would be using Kinect Depth Sensor. The motion of the hand would be directly be transferred to your phone screen. There would be support for detection of numerals as well.
If incorrectly drawn, add voice recognition to erase last step or get correct shape from pre-existing objects. It would help in learning of deaf and dumb too.

### FEATURE
* Drawing / Writing(Numbers)
* Speech Recognition: (Draw what is said)

### WHY?
It is easier to explain your idea to somebody using diagrams, that can be kept track of for later use too (when you explain something in air) and it can be used to teach people to draw basic shapes and objects and numerals. Also it can boon for disable people.

### INNOVATION
Integrate air writing into the artistic world rather than just accepting pre-defined set of letters. Accept voice command to correct a drawn shape.

### DEVELOPMENT PLAN
The first step would be to detect the finger position which is to be used then the next would be to connect the movement to the phone screen.
At the end, we would have to accept an user voice input to correct the drawing on some pre-existing objects.


### Equipment Required
1. Camera
2. Laser Pointer

### OUTCOME
By the end of the project, we expect to have a working prototype that models the problem statement . We hope the model would be easily adoptable for ready and direct use in the everyday work. We especially hope for the artists to get used to it. Also we hope it can be used to teach people how to draw and basic numbers.
