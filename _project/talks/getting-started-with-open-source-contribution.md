# Open Source contribution

<hr>

In simple term, Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

#### Why you should care about Open-Source?
Open Source is not confined to programmer or developer. People prefer open source software to proprietary software for a number of reasons, including:

* *Control*: As many people consider source should not be some one private property. OpenSource let to you to examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't want it to do, and they can change parts of it they don't like.

* *Training*: As mentioned, Open source code is publicly accessible, anyone can easily study it as they learn to make better software. Students can also share their work with others, inviting comment and critique, as they develop their skills. When people discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can share those mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same mistakes themselves.

* *Security*: I can summarize this one with [Linus Torvald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) famous quote.

   > "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"

  it is now considered as [Linus Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law).

* *Stability*: Due to ever changing hardware world compatibility becomes impossible task and as software is accessible to more people and it makes them to file bug easy and which lead them to be more stable.
