# Cameras

<hr/>

> The best camera is the one you have with you.

Though I won't deny in having best gear with you but capturing moments is a 70:30 game in which 70 depends on person and 30 camera. I love taking picture and the first camera I owned was Kodak KB10.

I learnt developing photographs from film in my uncle's photo studio. I used to spend most of my after school time in developing films. It used to be fun. Then I went to military school and almost forgot about this hobby as we were not allowed to keep any electronics.

### [Cannon EOS M](http://amzn.to/2dVsfxi){:target="_blank"}
After 7 years of photography exile, I retook it again last year and bought EOS M. It is a nice camera with Canon APS-C sensor which is good enough for beginners. It has all the feature which you can expect in a beginner DSLR camera. The only drawback I find it in as beginner DSLR camera is the view finder. The image quality is crisp and vibrant in color. You can read the review at [DPReview](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-eos-m).

***Why I choose this camera?***

Because it is portable and have similar capability as of [7D](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos7d).

### [iPhone 6S](http://amzn.to/2dYpHPY){:target="_blank"}
iPhone 6S tiny censor is capable of taking really good images. Comparing it with Samsung and other phone camera, I find iPhone 6S images much better. At the same time I will deny that it is not great for night shooting but in daylight you can take really good images.

### Camera Course
I was looking to improve my photography skill and being more DIY type, I didn't wanted to join some local in-person photography classes which is expensive also and so I stared looking for courses online. On hackernews [thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2939621){:target="_blank"}, I found information about [Digital Photography CS 178](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs178/){:target="_blank"} which is far the best course I came across. It has class assignments which is really a good way to practice what you have learnt.
