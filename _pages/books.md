# Reading List

<hr/>
I believe that a book is a life work of an author and he tries to take you through the journey of his own experiences.

***Why should we relish other people writing's?***

There can be numerous reasons. For e.g. I want to succeed, I want to be smart or may be I want to enjoy.

During childhood, I was kind of a story explorer. I used to keep looking for new stories to satify neurons. I used to hop around miles of distances to my friends houses to collect new comics books and weekly magazines which used to filled with mysterious, funny and act of goodness stories. After reading them, I used to have endless question in mind and I used to keep thinking for weeks. For e.g. What if I become the superhero? What will I do with powers? What If I become the disguise villain who world thinks the saviour?

So, In my childhood, I discovered that good stories/writing fuels curiosity and it is good to have within yourself.

For quite a time, I observed within myself that I am not able to present my ideas properly and so I was looking to improve it. After going through gazellions for articles which is kind of waste of time as you will get advice which works on a particular case. The better analogy would they teach you the sentences of language not the grammer.

Made to Stick is the grammar book on how effectivly you can convey your ideas.
