For quite a time, I observed within myself that I am not able to present my ideas properly. After going through gazillions for articles which is kind of waste of time as you will get advice which works on a particular case. A better analogy would be to say that articles teach you the sentences of language not the grammar and these sentences works on some simulated environments only, not all the places.

***Made to Stick*** is the grammar book on how effectively you can convey your ideas.
