I believe that a book is a life work of an author and he tries to take you through the journey of his own experiences. A question always intrigued me for quite a long time and it may be the same for many of you. i.e.

***Why should I read other people writing's?***

I always tried to think the answer in terms of pros and cons i.e. I want to succeed, I want to be smart or may be I want to enjoy; because that's the way we have been taught and so I was not able to grasp the essence of why.

One day, I decide to give a fresh look on finding the true reason and so started thinking about my childhood. During those years, I was kind of a story hunters/explorer. I used to keep looking for new stories in libraries and old books lying in home to satisfy my storyphile neurons. I used to hop around miles of distances to my friends houses to collect new comics books and weekly magazines which used to be filled with mystery, funny, good and bad emotions and most of the time after reading them, I used to have endless question in mind and some times I use to go in infinite loop thinking about them for weeks. The questions used to be: What if I become the superhero? What will I do with supers powers? Should I kill my oppunger neighbor with the power? Is killing good? What If I become the disguise villain who world thinks the Saviour?

***I discovered the essence reading i.e. good stories/writing fuels curiosity and imagination.*** Which are colossal thing to have in one's life.

What your essence? type in the comments!
