TL;DR Spoiler Alert

If you have stumbled upon this post, I will recommend you to go and first read Mark Manson post on [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck){:target="_blank"}. His post brings out the true definition of what it means to not give a fuck. I read his blog a year ago and truly followed the three described principle i.e.

* **NOT GIVING A FUCK DOES NOT MEAN BEING INDIFFERENT; IT MEANS BEING COMFORTABLE WITH BEING DIFFERENT**
* **TO NOT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ADVERSITY, YOU MUST FIRST GIVE A FUCK ABOUT SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN ADVERSITY**
* **WE ALL HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF FUCKS TO GIVE; PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE AND WHO YOU GIVE THEM TO**

and now I can feel the difference in my life. I haven't become the next [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk){:target="_blank"} or [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking){:target="_blank"} but for surely it has paved the way for inner greatness and satisfaction.

The title says "Rick".

> Who is Rick?

Rick is a main character in [Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty){:target="_blank"}  American animated science fiction comedy created by [Justin Roiland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Roiland){:target="_blank"} and [Dan Harmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon){:target="_blank"} for [Adult Swim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Swim){:target="_blank"}. He is a scientist and at first it seems, he doesn't care about anything.

After having a glimpse of the above portrait, you can get an overlay imagination of Rick's personality. Let's quickly move to the moot point of the post i.e. To understand why Rick doesn't give a fuck? I am trying to reverse engineer a human character and literally it takes years to imbibe in oneself. To get started, We will first need to learn a bit about Rick's personality, ambition and goal which will help us to simulate our life situations with his.

> Rick is an eccentric, alcoholic, mad scientist who views ***his time more valuable than others*** and he eschews the value of many ordinary human conventions such as school, marriage, and even love. His reaction to the mundane requests asked of him by family members suggests he considers himself wholly superior to them.


Sounds like bad characters to have in lieu with the current pseudo-conservative society. I agree with you. We don't need to be alcoholic to be carefree or considered other fellow being inferiors to us. *The fight is fucking with ourselves, fucking our own inner self.* Which is inside you, me and any human being. It has tamed in a cage of the worldly illusion of prosperity by sacrificing who you truly are. Here comes the first lesson.

It doesn't matter if you don't like the pasta spaghetti; say to your girlfriend on the face, even though it's her favorite and she is always insisting on having it. You can say your closest friend that you don't enjoy fucking boring jokes and it doesn't make you laugh at all. Just for once, tell your dubious inner-self shut the fuck up and let me be true to all these people. After all, they are your true friends, lovers and they should take it positively.

### Lesson 1

> Abstaining your true opinion is same as telling a lie.

Rick takes no chance in saying what he thinks about his family members on their face. I feel, it hurts to get a slanderous opinion about yourself from your closed one but if you just take a moment and think about it, you will soon realize; the real bravery and courage reside inside the sayer's not the receiver.

We need to appreciate these people in life instead of having prejudiced.

***Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub is Rick's catchphrase.***

In the episode Ricksy Business, Rick uses the above catchphrase multiple times, and Birdperson explains to Morty that in his language it means "I am in great pain, please help me." Though Rick is in great pain but he never shares this with others, I think it is because he doesn't want people should view him empathetically.

Grace and pray for those people who had said "fuck you" for good reason!

### Lesson 2

> In control of your surrounding.

How can you achieve the super power to control your environment? *Is it possible?* Yes, it is and up to a great extent. Let go through a simple analysis of daily routine. I will not be surprised if you say that 90% of what you do is repetitive and there is a hidden pattern (no one gives a shit about the mundane tasks) in the events leading to these tasks. BTW I am not talking about your shitty job routine here. The task can be anything you do which takes more than 5 minutes of your time i.e.

* Having breakfast
* Catching a bus
* Changing dress
* And infinite number of different things will come under 5 minutes time line

Now several tasks can make up an event and as human being, we remember only events. Your birthday is an event where you might have done several tasks like Getting dressed, call each friend, ordering cake etc. The idea is to break the task into as smaller subset as you can.

I will be giving my example of an event which has become an annoyance over the time. ***In Person Meeting With People*** due to several reasons. First, go through various tasks need to perform:

* Make a call
* Look for mutual time
* Set reminder
* Get dressed on meeting day (might involve more time, make up for girls :P)
* Look out for cabs/buses
* Traffic
* Call again
* Look out here and there
* Finally meet

Now bring out the all the things which can turn bad and can lead to a certain output.

* Delay in meeting
* Synchronization
* Emotional kill/Frustration
* End up without meeting due to above reasons


Every task has their own output as issues, traffic can delay your meeting time, You can't find cabs/buses, Your clothes are not ironed, so many things can happen and this will hit your emotional nerve. For me traveling in Bangalore traffic and then waiting for hours on the way is a nightmare. In simple maths terms, there are a lot of variables with dependency on outputs (Long waiting for hours in traffic(variable) can delay in meeting(output)). The key to controlling your environment lies in: How can we achieve certainty over these variables and output dependency?

*** Even the most chaotic life have pattern ***

The idea is to analyze tasks which have maximum dependency with your output (many-to-one)

| Task | Output |
| Make a call | synchronization |
| Look for mutual time | synchronization |
| Set reminder  | Delay in meeting |
|               | Emotional kill |
|               | End up not meeting |
| Traffic | Delay in meeting |
|         | Emotional kill |


If a task has greater dependency, I will try ways to solve it first. Most of the time mismatch in reaching time happens because I do not have a proper reminder for it and you can see in above table. I started having reminders on my calendar with 15, 10, 5 minutes before notifications alerts. These have helped me reduced all the next subsequent problems. Looking for these small nitty gritty is the key and then trying to solve with the resources within your hand will help to have greater control over the environment.


Throughout the show, you will find Rick have a way to get through almost any situation but panicking hell out of his grandson Morty. I think it's because with his knowledge and experience, he had made his dependency graph almost perfect and he is well aware of the outcome of the tasks as well as risk involved in each of it and that is his secret of carefree confidence but in one episode i.e. ---Schrodinger cat--- he left out with no choice but to pray god to save his life.


So, no one is perfect and there may be a deviation from what you are expecting as the outcome but sooner or later if you have done meticulous research for the situation you will get through with better confidence by solving each smaller task. Here I will stop this lesson because you might have already heard thousands of rants by successful people from here.


### Lesson 3

> Start accepting rejection gracefully

Let me ask you all a questions: Do you love rejections? Most of us will agree we don't. I guess only those people are on the positive side of it are who realizes that there is more good in accepting it than opposing it. Accepting rejection doesn't mean you are demeaning yourself, it is more about introspecting one's own actions.

If you want to learn the art of accepting rejections, I will recommend reading [*REJECTION PROOF*](http://amzn.to/2fm1Vy1){:target="_blank"} by Jia Jiang.

In the final episode of season 2 (The Wedding Squanchers), Rick escapes from the wedding with his family members after the Galactic Federation's deep cover agent Tammy attacks everyone. Tammy was sent to hunt down Rick. Rick left with no choice to find another livable planet as Earth is no longer a safe place for him.

Unable to return home and not at all happy with the idea of living out their lives on a planet roughly the size of a major metropolis, a family meeting is called. Jerry, in his typical cowardly fashion, wants to turn Rick over so they can go home, while Beth doesnâ€™t want to see her father leave, afraid of again suffering through his abandonment.

Rick accepts this rejection from his own loved one and surrender.
